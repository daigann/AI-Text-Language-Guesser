# AI-Text-Language-Guesser

This is a small program I've written in Python that builds a keras neural network which will learn to identify if a word is an English word, German word, or French word.

I've included the text files for a bunch of English, German, and French words to use as both the training and testing set. The program randomly selects which words will be used as the training set or the testing set. The probabilities is about 80/20 - training/testing. 

After training is complete a graph will display how well the neural network guessed the language of each word in the testing set.
